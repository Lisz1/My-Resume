<h2>Bookworm & Storyteller</h2>
 I’m a huge fan of books, especially fiction. I love diving into different worlds through reading and creating my own through writing. Fiction is my specialty, but I’m also exploring poetry.
  
<h2>Artist at Heart</h2>
I express myself through drawing and painting, bringing ideas to life on paper and canvas. I also enjoy crafting ceramic wares, shaping raw materials into something beautiful.
  
<h2>Melody & Creativity</h2>
Singing is my happy place! Whether it's humming a tune or singing my heart out, music is a big part of me. And yes, I eat a lot – good food is an art of its own!
  
<h2>Always Exploring</h2>
 I’m always open to learning new creative skills and expanding my artistic expressions. Right now, I’m diving deeper into poetry and finding new ways to tell stories.
